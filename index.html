<h2>Gib Goy Games</h2>
<p>"Thinking toys for big birls and goys."</p>

<p>"'Gib Goy' is 'Big Boy' spelled sideways. Sort of." -- Bill St. Clair, proprietor</p>

<p>Our first product, <a href='kakuro/'>Kakuro Dojo</a>, is available for iOS and Android.</p>

<p><a href='spokes/'>Spokes</a> is a board game, invented by my son, Chris St. Clair. Click the "Help" and "Rules" links above and below the board to learn how to play.</p>

<p><a href='archmage/'>Archmage</a> is a simpler board game that Chris invented. Easier to learn, but still plenty interesting. Click the "Help" and "Rules" links above and below the board to learn how to play.</p>

<p><a href='https://zephyrnot.com/'>Zephyrnot</a> is another of Chris's inventions. Click the "Instructions" and "Rules" links below the board to learn how to play. Networked play in development.</p>

<p><a href='http://jsmaze.com/'>JSMaze</a> is a simple first-person maze game, patterned after a game I played at MIT in the late 1970s, on the PDP-10 and Imlac terminals at Project Mac. Still in development. Networked play and chat coming.</p>

<p><a href='zippy/'>Zippy</a> is a little hack that makes images of Zippy the Pinhead, Milo, and Mr. Natural bounce around the screen. Silly and funny, with real elastic collision simulation.</p>
